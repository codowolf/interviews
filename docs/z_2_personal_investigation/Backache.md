### Prompt

Starting from 2019 when I was going to the gym and started doing squats or was it dead lift I'm not sure. I have been having lower back pain on the left side. It is around Gluteus medius. The pain is unbearable if I am sitting on the toilet seat for about 20 minutes, it starts getting better as I walk. I've gone to a couple of therapy sessions and it was noticed that my hamstrings are extremely tight. My cords are extremely tight, but in the last two weeks I've been getting lower back ache. It's right around the X and it's on the left side none of the stretching is helping my physical therapist has told me to keep doing the stretching and let us get the flexibility first and then focus on the pain. What's weird is that the pain on my gluten medius now seems insignificant compared to the pain I have now I'm unable to bend and pick up objects. I'm unable to put on my pants or my socks. I mean I can, but it's just hurts in that position. I've been using a massager to massage that area and also my glutes and upper back. I have no idea what they could be. This pain started happening right after I felt sick and I was lying down on my bed for about a week and a week later this pain started happening not right after I got better but also I have been coughing during those two weeks a lot and somewhere I read that it could also be because of the coughing, but I don't think so two months before I started physical therapy and they recommended me some basic good exercises like leg races and stuff like that and band exercises, but that was more about handling the pain in my gluteus medius not the pain I have right now, but in general, my lower back has always felt weak, especially when I lift luggage to put in my car I feel like my lower back is weak, and I can feel the pain for the next couple of days.

Another point I want to call out is that my pain is significantly worse when I wake up in the morning and it is getting better by the end of the day I thought the exercises would help me feel better, but it just doesn't get better in the morning, no matter how much exercises I do but eventually before going to bed I feel much much better than in the morning a couple of things that could help you understand this better is that my left leg is slightly bigger than my right and I haven't been going to the gym in the last 6 to 8 months. I have a walking pad at home and I have noticed that with an incline of 6Â° and running at a pace of less than 3.2 after like 30 or 40 minutes the glutenous medius pain on the left side starts hurting.


### Response
- **Onset and Initial Pain (2019):**
    - Pain started in 2019 after doing squats or deadlifts at the gym.
    - Initially located on the **left side of your lower back, around the gluteus medius**.
    - Pain is **unbearable when sitting on the toilet for ~20 minutes**, but improves with walking.
- **Physical Therapy & Hamstring Tightness:**
    - You've had a couple of physical therapy sessions.
    - It was noted that your **hamstrings and "cords" are extremely tight**.
    - Your therapist recommended continuing stretching to improve flexibility before focusing on pain.
- **Recent Pain Changes (Last 2 Weeks):**
    - Developed new, more intense **lower back ache on the left side, around "1 inch above and below the dimples, about 2-3 inch area"
    - This new pain makes the gluteus medius pain feel insignificant.
    - You are **unable to bend to pick up objects or put on pants/socks** without significant pain.
    - Massaging the affected area, glutes, and upper back provides some relief, but very temporary. Even the temporary relief has stopped in the last two days
    - The pain goes from 2-6 sudden sharp pain while bending on only high during motion, not stopped.
    - Coughing also gives very sharp pain and it's making me afraid of coughin and sneezing.
- **Potential Triggers for Recent Pain:**
    - The recent pain started about a week after being sick and lying in bed for a week.
    - You've been coughing a lot in the last two weeks, and you read that coughing could contribute to back pain (though you doubt it).
- **Previous Treatments & General Back Weakness:**
    - Two months before current physical therapy, you had basic exercises recommended (leg raises, band exercises) for gluteus medius pain, not the current severe lower back pain.
    - You've always felt your **lower back is weak, especially when lifting luggage**, leading to pain for a couple of days afterward.
- **Morning Stiffness & Daily Fluctuation:**
    - Pain is **significantly worse in the morning** and gradually improves throughout the day.
    - Exercises don't seem to alleviate morning pain, but you feel much better by bedtime.
    - Note that I mostly sleep on my sides on a bed with very soft cushioning 
- **Additional Observations:**
    - Your **left leg is slightly larger than your right leg**.
    - You haven't been to the gym in 6-8 months.
    - When using a walking pad with a 6-degree incline at a pace less than 3.2 for 30-40 minutes, your **left gluteus medius pain starts hurting**.
