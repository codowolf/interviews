You have a dataset of many (x, y) pairs, and these points usually don't fall perfectly on a straight line.\n\nThe goal of simple linear regression is to find the \"best-fit\" straight line $$y = mx + c$$ that minimizes the distance (or, more precisely, the squared distance) between the line and all the data points. The m and c values that define this best-fit line are called the **coefficients** or **parameters** of the model.\n\nDoes this initial explanation clarify `y = mx + c`, slope, and intercept for you? We can go deeper into the \"best-fit\" line and how it's found if you'd like!","x":-1058,"y":-40,"width":638,"height":360,"color":"3"},
