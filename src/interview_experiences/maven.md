- R1 — Project Round
- R2 — Coding

```python
Given mxn grid of 
'x' — obstacle
'p' — patient (single)
'c' — clinics

there's only one patient, 
1. find nearest hospital 

Extension
— Trace the path of nearest hospital to patient
  - Essentially you have to keep hashmap of chain of previous node

Extension 
- There are multiple patients, and no obstacles. Find a spot in mxn which is the minimum sum distance to all patients
- HINT: Can be done in O(m x n)
- This required DP
- 
```
