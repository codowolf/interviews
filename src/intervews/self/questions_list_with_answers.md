### **Part 1: Project Deep Dive (Technical & Impact)**

**1. Project Overview & Business Context:**
*   What was the primary goal or problem your project aimed to solve?
	* The primary goal of my GenAI initiative was to **tackle significant operational inefficiencies within our claims handling process.** Our internal claims operations team, which is crucial for managing costs and risk, was burdened by highly manual and time-consuming workflows.
	* Essentially, the project’s mission was to use GenAI to **augment our human experts**, giving them superpowers to digest vast amounts of information quickly, make faster, more informed decisions, and ultimately reduce the time and cost associated with each claim.
	* This manifested in three key problems we aimed to solve:
		* **High Average Handle Time (AHT):** Advocates were spending too much time manually gathering information, reading notes, and getting up to speed on complex claims. This directly led to missing our SLAs for submitting claims to our insurance partners, increasing our risk profile.
		* **Information Overload & Slow Analysis:** A single claim can generate hundreds of pages of documents—police reports, medical records, legal filings. Our claims strategists had to read through these dense documents manually, which slowed down their ability to assess severity and make strategic decisions.
		* **Lack of Immediate Visibility:** It was difficult for an advocate, especially one new to a claim, to quickly grasp its severity and history. This delay could mean the difference between a quick settlement and a claim escalating into costly litigation.
*   What was the **business context or strategic importance** of this project to the company or its users?
	* This project was strategically vital because it directly addressed **one of the largest operational cost centers for Lyft: insurance and claims.** The context is that every dollar we save in claims settlement has a direct impact on the company's profitability
	* The strategic importance was twofold:
		* **Direct Cost Reduction:** Our insurance premiums are heavily **influenced by our loss history**. By creating more efficient workflows, we enable our team to close claims faster and at lower costs. For example, by quickly identifying a high-severity claim, we can intervene before it escalates into a lawsuit, which is where costs skyrocket. This project provided the tools to do exactly that, with the long-term goal of improving our loss history and negotiating lower insurance premiums.
		* **Risk Mitigation:** The longer a claim stays open, the higher the risk of litigation and inflated costs. By accelerating the initial reporting (FNOL) and the strategic review process, we shrink the window for that risk. **This isn't just about saving money on a single claim; it's about systematically de-risking a core part of our business.**
		* Furthermore, this was a greenfield project that proved the value of GenAI on a tangible, expensive business problem. It positioned our org as an innovator within Lyft and set a precedent for how to responsibly deploy this technology to drive real business value.
*   How did **this project** align with broader organizational objectives?
	* The project aligned perfectly with our objectives at every level of the organization.
		- **At the Team Level:** Our team's mission is to `enable our claims ops team to have the most efficient workflows.` This project was a direct execution of that mission. We targeted the most manual, time-consuming parts of their day and built tools to automate and accelerate them.
		- **At the Org & Company Level:** Our 'Insurance & Risk' org's goal is to `Make Rides as safe as possible.` While my project was post-accident, it's a critical part of that ecosystem. By effectively and efficiently managing the aftermath of an accident, we fulfill our responsibility to our users and the public. More importantly, we manage the financial risk associated with accidents, which allows the company to continue investing in pre-accident safety initiatives. Reducing the cost of risk is central to the org's purpose. **It's about systematically de-risking a core part of our business.**
*   Who were the key stakeholders (users, other teams, leadership)?
	* As the lead on this initiative, I managed a wide range of stakeholders:
	- **Primary End-Users (The 'Customer'):** Our 250-300 person Claims Ops, FNOL Ops, and Legal teams. They were our most important stakeholder. I worked directly with a core group of five operators in continuous feedback loops, conducting shadow sessions to deeply understand their pain points and ensure the tools we built were genuinely useful and integrated into their daily work.
	- **Leadership & Sponsors:** My Engineering Director, VP, and the Director of Operations. I was responsible for communicating the vision, the roadmap, and the business impact to them. Their buy-in was critical for securing resources for what started as a one-person greenfield idea.
	- **The Project Team:** This included the engineers I led and mentored, our Product Manager, and our Designer. My role was to provide the technical vision and architecture, unblock them, and collaborate closely with Design on UX, providing significant feedback to ensure the final product was intuitive for our non-technical users.
	- **Cross-Functional Partners:** We collaborated with our internal ML Platform and Infrastructure teams to leverage their foundational tools for AWS and OpenAI access. The Legal team was also a key stakeholder, both as an end-user and as a consultant on data privacy.
	- **External Vendors:** We had a direct relationship with OpenAI as a vendor. When we faced performance and accuracy issues with their models on sensitive documents, I was involved in the decision-making process that led us to integrate with AWS Bedrock and Claude to resolve the problem.
*   How did ethical considerations (e.g., data privacy, bias in AI/ML, accessibility) factor into the project's goals or design?
	* Ethical considerations were at the forefront of our design and architecture from day one, primarily in three areas:
		1. **Data Privacy and Security:** This was our biggest constraint and a core design principle. We handle extremely sensitive PII and medical information. Because of this, we made a critical architectural decision to **exclusively use stateless vendor APIs.** We could not send conversation histories or sensitive data to be stored by third parties. This meant we had to take on the engineering burden of building our own secure persistence layer and conversation state management internally. It was more work, but it was non-negotiable for protecting our users' data.
		2. **Accuracy and Reliability:** An inaccurate summary of a medical report or legal document could lead to a poor decision with serious financial and human consequences. We recognized this risk early. When we launched our document intelligence feature, we monitored it closely and found a 5% error rate on certain sensitive documents. This was unacceptable. We treated this as a critical incident, escalated it, and I was part of the rapid response to integrate and switch to a more reliable model via AWS Bedrock, which resolved the issue. This commitment to accuracy was paramount.
		3. **Human-in-the-Loop & Explainability:** We consciously designed these tools to **augment, not replace,** our human experts. A key ethical principle was ensuring our operators always had the final say and could trust the tool. We built explainability directly into the product. For instance, when the chatbot answers a question, it provides references back to the source data in the claim, so the operator can immediately click and verify the information for themselves. This builds trust and ensures the AI is a responsible assistant, not an unaccountable black box.

**2. Your Role & Contributions:**
*   What was your specific role and key responsibilities on this project?
	* My specific role was the **Staff Engineer and technical lead for the entire GenAI initiative.** Since this was a greenfield project, my responsibilities were broad and evolved with the project's lifecycle:
		1. **Vision and Strategy:** Initially, my primary responsibility was to transform an ambiguous mandate—'explore GenAI'—into a concrete, actionable roadmap. This involved identifying high-value use cases, defining the project's vision, and getting buy-in from leadership to secure resources.
		2. **Technical Architecture:** I was responsible for designing the end-to-end technical architecture for the entire platform, ensuring it was scalable, secure, and flexible enough to support not just our first feature, but the entire future roadmap.
		3. **Team Leadership and Mentorship:** I led the project team of four engineers. This involved breaking down complex architectural problems into manageable workstreams, conducting design and code reviews, unblocking technical challenges, and mentoring the engineers to grow their skills in this new domain.
		4. **Cross-functional Execution:** I acted as the primary technical point of contact for Product, Design, and our Ops stakeholders. I worked to ensure the solutions we built were not just technically sound, but also solved the real-world problems our users faced.
*   What were your direct, individual contributions? (Be specific: "I designed X," "I implemented Y," "I optimized Z"). (**Use "I" statements)
	* I made several direct contributions across the project's lifecycle:
		- **At the Ideation Stage:**
		    - **I initiated the project** by proactively building several small proofs-of-concept to demonstrate the potential of LLMs on our claims data, which caught leadership's attention.
		    - **I conducted the initial user research**, running shadow sessions with our Ops team to pinpoint their biggest pain points, which directly led to identifying document analysis as the highest-impact problem to solve.
		    - **I authored the initial vision and strategy document** that defined the phased approach—starting with a foundational ChatBot and then building Document Intelligence on top of it.
		- **On the Technical Design and Architecture:**
		    - **I designed the foundational backend architecture for our conversational AI service.** A key part of my design was the decision to build our own state management layer on top of stateless vendor APIs to meet our strict data privacy requirements.
		    - **I designed the entire asynchronous pipeline for our Document Intelligence feature.** This included the logic for chunking large PDFs, parallelizing image pre-processing and text extraction, and aggregating the results to meet our sub-30-second SLA.
		    - **I personally drove the technical investigation** comparing AWS Textract and multi-modal LLMs for OCR, creating a decision framework based on accuracy tests across hundreds of varied documents.
		- **During Implementation and Problem-Solving:**
		    - **I led the initial prompt engineering efforts**, establishing a framework for iterative testing and a feedback loop for continuous improvement.
		    - I lead the optimization efforts in image processing, retries — high mem / cpu usage
		    - When we hit a critical 5% error rate post-launch, **I was directly involved in the rapid response**, evaluating alternative models and leading the technical integration with AWS Bedrock and Claude to resolve the issue.
		    - **I designed the RAG architecture** to mitigate context window limitations, including the strategy of using an LLM to generate multiple queries for better retrieval and re-ranking.
* What aspects of the project were you primarily accountable for?
	* I was ultimately accountable for several key aspects of the project's success:
		1. **The Technical Viability and Long-Term Strategy:** I owned the technical direction. It was my responsibility to ensure that the architecture we built wasn't just a short-term fix, but a scalable platform that the company could build upon for years to come. The success or failure of our technical choices rested with me.
		2. **Delivering Business Value:** I was accountable for ensuring that the complex technology we were building translated into a tangible solution for our users. If we built a technically brilliant tool that the Ops team didn't adopt because it didn't solve their problem, I would have considered that my failure.
		3. **Meeting Security and Privacy Requirements:** The decision to use stateless APIs was a critical one I championed. I was accountable for making sure our implementation was secure and protected our users' highly sensitive data. A data breach would have been a direct failure of the architecture I owned.
		4. **The Technical Quality of the Team's Output:** As the lead, I was accountable for the overall quality, robustness, and maintainability of the code and systems the team produced. This meant setting a high bar through design reviews, code reviews, and establishing best practices.
* How did your contributions directly enable the success of the project?
	* **My initial vision and strategy work transformed an ambiguous idea into a funded project.** By identifying a clear, high-impact problem and presenting a phased roadmap, I gave leadership the confidence to invest resources, enabling the project to exist in the first place.
	- **The privacy-centric architecture I designed was the key to getting the project approved.** By designing a system that worked with stateless APIs, I unblocked our Legal and Security concerns. Without that specific design, we would not have been able to proceed with any vendor LLMs.
	- **My decision to build a foundational chat platform first, instead of a one-off document tool, accelerated future development.** It created a reusable, scalable foundation. This meant that when we started building Document Intelligence and other features, we weren't starting from scratch, saving the team months of development time.
	- **My leadership during the post-launch accuracy crisis saved the project's credibility.** By quickly identifying the root cause and driving the rapid integration of a new model, I ensured our users maintained trust in the tool. This was critical for long-term adoption and the overall success of the initiative.
