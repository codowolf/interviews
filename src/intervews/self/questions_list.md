Below is the **combined, comprehensive list** of Staff-level interview questions, incorporating all the elements from our previous discussions. This includes:


Questions are phrased as before, with logical grouping to avoid redundancy. This list is exhaustive for Staff-level preparation, drawing from common patterns at FAANG/MAANG companies and beyond.

Before the full list, I've included a **Summary Table of Category Areas**. This table provides a high-level overview of the categories, sub-categories, and a brief description of the focus area. It helps in quickly navigating or prioritizing preparation (e.g., based on your strengths/weaknesses).
