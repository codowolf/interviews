# Question
One question per hour. Never seen it before
Write two functions to process characters, one compress and one decompress.
Input is like "aaabbbbbbcccccddd", and output is up to you.
I thought of "a3b6c4d3". I ran out of time after writing and debugging. There are some edge cases to consider, such as "abc" instead of "a1b1c1" .
The interviewer, a white lady, is very good and will give reminders.
Follow up is how to decompress if it is a multi-digit number, such as "a12b13".
Then asked what to do if str is very long, the answer is split and then merge, pay attention to the situation of split staggered how to merge, such as "aaaa", "aabc"
and also asked what to do if there are numbers in str, I didn't answer it, welcome to provide some ideas, good luck in the interview
